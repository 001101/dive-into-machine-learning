      <p>Hi there! This guide is for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're new to Machine Learning</li>
<li>You can understand and write Python code. (If you want to learn Python, try <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/">Dive Into Python.</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I learned Python by hacking first, and getting serious <em>later.</em> I wanted to do this with Machine Learning. If this is your style, join me in getting a bit ahead of yourself.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> There are several fields within "Data," and Machine Learning is just one. It's good to know the context: <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Data-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1">What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?</a></p>

<p>I suggest you get your feet wet ASAP. You'll boost your confidence.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tools-youll-need" class="anchor" href="#tools-youll-need" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tools you'll need</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>. (I'm using 2.7.5) and <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html">pip</a>, the Python package manager</li>
<li>
<a href="http://ipython.org/install.html">ipython</a> and IPython Notebook. <code>pip install "ipython[notebook]"</code>
</li>
<li>Some scientific computing packages: <code>pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib numpy</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're only using Python for scientific computing, you can grab these tools in one convenient package: <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">scikit-learn</a> is the go-to library for machine learning in Python. <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/testimonials/testimonials.html">Some recognizable logos use it, including Spotify and Evernote.</a> Machine learning is complex. You'll be glad your tools are simple.</p>

<p>I encourage you to look at the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">scikit-learn</a> homepage  and spend about 5 minutes looking over the names of the strategies (Classification, Regression, etc.), and their applications.

<p>Read <strong><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Epedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</a></strong> by Pedro Domingos. It's densely packed with valuable information, but not opaque. The author understands that there's a lot of "black art" and folk wisdom, and they invite you in.</p>

<p>Take your time with this one. Take notes. Don't worry if you don't understand it all yet.</p>

<p>The whole paper is packed with value, but I want to call out two points:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Data alone is not enough.</strong> This is where science meets art in machine-learning. Quoting Domingos: "... the need for knowledge in learning should not be surprising. Machine learning is not magic; it can’t get something from nothing. What it does is get more from less. Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of work: we have to build everything from scratch. Learning is more like farming, which lets nature do most of the work. Farmers combine seeds with nutrients to grow crops. Learners combine knowledge with data to grow programs."</li>
<li>
<strong>More data beats a cleverer algorithm.</strong> Listen up, programmers. We like cool tools. Resist the temptation to reinvent the wheel, or to over-engineer solutions. Your starting point is to <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest3.html">Do the Simplest Thing that Could <em>Possibly</em> Work</a>. Quoting Domingos: "Suppose you’ve constructed the best set of features you can, but the classifiers you’re getting are still not accurate enough. What can you do now? There are two main choices: design a better learning algorithm, or gather more data. [...] As a rule of thumb, a dumb algorithm with lots and lots of data beats a clever one with modest amounts of it. (After all, machine learning is all about letting data do the heavy lifting.)"</li>
</ul>

<p>So  <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>data</strong> are critical. Focus your efforts on those, before fussing about algorithms. In practice, this means that unless you <em>have</em> to increase complexity, you should continue to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoSimpleThings">Do Simple Things</a>; don't rush to neural networks just because they're cool. To improve your model, get more data  and use your knowledge of the problem to manipulate the data. You should spend most of your time on these steps. Only optimize your choice of algorithms after you've got enough data, and you've processed it well.</p>

<p>(The image above was inspired by a slide from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVCVzEJhhQ">Alex Pinto's talk, "Secure Because Math: A Deep-Dive on ML-Based Monitoring</a>.)</p>

<a id="talking-machines" class="anchor" href="#talking-machines" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Talking Machines</h2>

<p>Subscribe to <strong><a href="http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/">Talking Machines</a></strong>, a podcast about machine learning. It's great. It's a low-effort, high-yield way to learn more.</p>

<p>I suggest this listening order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with the <a href="http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/4/23/starting-simple-and-machine-learning-in-meds">"Starting Simple"</a> episode. It supports what we read from Domingos. Ryan Adams talks about starting simple, as discussed above. Adams also stresses the importance of feature engineering. Feature engineering is an exercise of the "knowledge" Domingos writes about.</li>
<li>Then, start over from the first episode</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.</p>

<p>If you're using machine learning for unscientific reasons, like benefiting users ... as always you've got to keep your users in mind.</p>

<p>I have a friend who worked at <code>&lt;Redacted&gt;</code> Music Streaming Service. This company used machine learning in their recommendation and radio services. He complained about the way the company scored the radio feature's performance. There was disagreement about what should be scored. They used a metric, "no song skips." But why? Sure that indicates the recommendation wasn't <em>awful</em>, what if you want to measure engagement? Other metrics could measure positive engagement: "favorites," shares, listening time, or whether the listener returns to the radio station later. Measuring "no skips" might work for the passive listener, but the engaged listener is different. Perhaps the engaged listener will skip 5 songs, but find 20 songs they love and come back to the service later.</p>

<p><strong>My takeaway:</strong> if you use machine learning to benefit your users, you must understand your users. You must understand <em>which kind</em> of user you're trying to benefit. Without the right measurement, you can't optimize your users' experiences.</p>

<p>Here are some obvious tools to reach for: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark.</a></strong>

<ul>
<li>I mean, hell, <a href="http://databricks.com/blog/2015/02/17/introducingdataframes-in-spark-for-large-scale-data-science.html">Spark has DataFrames and easy co-operability with pandas!</a>
</li>
<li>Berkeley has <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/scalable-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs190-1x#.VOC70VPF_lQ">a course on Scalable Machine Learning, focusing on Apache Spark.</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://netflix.github.io/#repo">NetflixOSS</a> (see "Big Data Tools")

<ul>
<li><a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/01/introducing-surus-and-scorepmml.html">Netflix: Surus and ScorePMML</a></li>

<p>For Machine-Learning libraries that might not be on GitHub, there's <a href="http://mloss.org/software/">MLOSS (Machine Learning Open Source Software)</a>. Seems to feature many academic libraries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> has really exciting <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/competitions">competitions</a> and a <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/jobs">data science job board</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, here are other guides to Machine Learning:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://xyclade.github.io/MachineLearning/">Machine Learning for Developers</a> is another good introduction. It introduces machine learning for a developer audience using Smile, a machine learning library that can be used both in Java and Scala.</li>
